This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course held by the University of Tartu. This project was a competition that used Kaggle's [Real / Fake Job Posting Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction) dataset. For the competition, the dataset was split into train and dev sets provided to students, and the test set that was used for evaluation and ranking. The provided data can be found in the ```task2_data``` folder.
